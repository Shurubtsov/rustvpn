Review the current state of documentation in docs/ and suggest what needs updating based on recent code changes. Check:
1. Does docs/ARCHITECTURE.md match current module structure?
2. Does docs/XRAY_CONFIG.md cover all config generation options?
3. Is docs/DEVELOPMENT.md accurate for current setup steps?
